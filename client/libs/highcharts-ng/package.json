( _Please see the FAQ below for details_ )\n\n- See http://pablojim.github.io/highcharts-ng/examples/example.html for an extended example. Also Available in the example directory - thanks @crusat\n- Basic example: http://jsfiddle.net/pablojim/Hjdnw/\n- Example with dynamic x-axis: http://jsfiddle.net/pablojim/7cAq3/\n- Basic highstocks example http://jsfiddle.net/pablojim/r88yszk0/\n- Support for Highmaps - see: http://rawgit.com/pablojim/highcharts-ng/master/example/maps/example.html\n- Getting access to the Chart object/Add a print button - http://jsfiddle.net/pablojim/m4pcpv5g/\n\nThe `chartConfig` attribute mentioned above resembles an exploded highcharts options object:\n\n```javascript\n//This is not a highcharts object. It just looks a little like one!\nvar chartConfig = {\n\n  options: {\n      //This is the Main Highcharts chart config. Any Highchart options are valid here.\n      //will be overriden by values specified below.\n      chart: {\n          type: 'bar'\n      },\n      tooltip: {\n          style: {\n              padding: 10,\n              fontWeight: 'bold'\n          }\n      }\n  },\n  //The below properties are watched separately for changes.\n\n  //Series object (optional) - a list of series using normal highcharts series options.\n  series: [{\n     data: [10, 15, 12, 8, 7]\n  }],\n  //Title configuration (optional)\n  title: {\n     text: 'Hello'\n  },\n  //Boolean to control showng loading status on chart (optional)\n  //Could be a string if you want to show specific loading text.\n  loading: false,\n  //Configuration for the xAxis (optional). Currently only one x axis can be dynamically controlled.\n  //properties currentMin and currentMax provied 2-way binding to the chart's maximimum and minimum\n  xAxis: {\n  currentMin: 0,\n  currentMax: 20,\n  title: {text: 'values'}\n  },\n  //Whether to use HighStocks instead of HighCharts (optional). Defaults to false.\n  useHighStocks: false,\n  //size (optional) if left out the chart will default to size of the div or something sensible.\n  size: {\n   width: 400,\n   height: 300\n  },\n  //function (optional)\n  func: function (chart) {\n   //setup some logic for the chart\n  }\n};\n```\n\nAll properties on the chart configuration are optional. If you don't need a feature best to leave it out completely - Highcharts will usually default to something sensible. Each property is watched for changes by angularjs.\nNOTE:\nA common error is to put other highcharts options directly into the chartConfig.\nIn general if the highcharts option you want isn't listed above you probably want to put it in chartConfig.options\n\nThe Highcharts object can be accessed with ```chartConfig.getHighcharts()```. This is a simple way to access all the Highcharts API that is not currently managed by this directive. See the JSFiddle basic example to see how this is used to call the print function of Highcharts.\n\nFeatures:\n---------\n\n- Adding and removing series\n- Setting/Updating Chart options\n- Updating the chart title\n- 2 way binding to chart xAxis\n- Control of Loading status\n- Resizes with screen size changes.\n\n\nCaveats:\n--------\n\n- Due to many equality checks the directive maybe slow with large datasets\n- Whole Chart/Series is often redrawn where a simple update of data would suffice\n- If you don't assign ids to your series - incremental ids will be added\n- The 2 way binding to xAxis properties should be treated as experimental\n- Navigator/scrollbar cannot run with liveRedraw enabled at this time\n- Needs tests!\n\nFAQ:\n--------\n\n\n- Why doesn't my plot options/tooltip/drilldown/other feature work?\n\n*At least half of all issues filed are due to this. Before you file an issue read this!*\nA common error is to put other highcharts options directly into the chartConfig.\nIn general if the highcharts option you want isn't listed above you probably want to put it in chartConfig.options.\n\n- How do I get access to the chart object?\n\nFrom version 0.0.8 onwards you can use `config.getHighcharts`. 95% of the time you won't need this and should instead change the chartConfig instead.\n\nBe careful - if you manually change something with the chart object that is also in the chartConfig the chart and the config may end up out of sync.  \n\n- Why don't you just use the standard highcharts format?\n\nLets consider the below snippet.\n\n```\n$scope.chartConfig = {\n   options: {...}, //highcharts options - using standard highcharts config\n   //other \"dynamic\" options\n   title: {...}\n   series [...]\n}\n```\nIn the ```chartConfig``` object above the ```options``` property is a standard highcharts options object. e.g. anything you can pass into ````new Highcharts.Chart(options);``` works here.\n\nThis options object is watched for changes. When something changes here the whole chart is recreated.\n\nThe other dynamic properties are ones that we can change without affecting the whole chart - using the api at http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#Chart e.g. if you change the title we can call chart.setTitle and not have to recreate the whole chart. Splitting them out from the main options object means we can watch them separately.\n\nSo anything that has an api to change is declared outside the main options object.\n\nHope this makes sense! \n\n\n- The chart does not fit into the parent container? How to fix that?\n \nThis may happen for example, when you place your chart in a bootstrap col - element. For now, you may apply the following workaround to fit your chart in the container:\n\n```\n        $scope.config = {\n            options: {\n            ...\n            },\n            ...\n            // other configuration here,\n            ...\n            func: function(chart) {\n                $timeout(function() {\n                    chart.reflow();\n                }, 0);\n            }\n        };\n    }\n```\nThis forces the chart to reflow after container and chart have finished rendering. Don't forget to include the dependency to $timeout.
